Space Jump
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nfriedly/space-jump.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nfriedly/space-jump)

Space-themed game along the lines of doodle jump. 
Not-very-accurate physics, but fun to play (or at least it should be when I'm done.)

Try it out at http://nfriedly.github.io/space-jump/

Todo
----
* better artwork
* better physics
* sounds (and music?)
* explosions on a hard collision
* some effect for soft collision
* moving platforms (?)
* "real" tests
* clean up design
